# ipsum

ipsum is an editor that I'm writing. It'll be modal, and roughly feature the functionality of the subset of vim I use. I'm making it for fun, but will probably make an attempt at using it.

The basic implementation approach is somewhat similar to [kilo](http://github.com/antirez/kilo), like a lot of toy editors. However, I'm using libraries like [termion](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/termion) and [ropey](https://github.com/cessen/ropey). This allows me to write a performant editor fairly quickly.
