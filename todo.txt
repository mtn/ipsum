- synchronous rendering
- pager

    - render text from ropes
- modes

        - eg. insert comment, based on language definition

eventual
- proper asynchronous stdin with mpsc and tokio
- detecting resizing
- text soft wrapping
- pencil mode?
- communication with language servers?
- replace unwraps with better error handling
    - I don't think destructors are called on panic, which would mean
      the terminal would remain in raw mode if an unwrapped operation failed
